**Habistat** is an open-source **habit-tracker** focused on privacy and simplicity. It helps you build good habits, break bad ones, and track daily activity, with your data fully under your control. Features include time-based habit tracking and optional gamification: streaks, points, and a virtual garden that grows – ideally, like you. 🌱

An alternative to apps like **[Everyday](https://everyday.app/)**, **[Habitify](https://www.habitify.me/)**, and **[Habitica](https://habitica.com/)**, it is built with the lightweight **[Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/)** framework and runs smoothly on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and in any modern browser.

## ⛩️ Why Habistat?

Tired of bloated apps and shaky privacy policies? Habistat keeps it simple. Inspired by "Don't Break the Chain," it turns habit tracking into a daily checkmark ritual. Each completed habit advances your streak, grows a virtual plant, and earns points.
