## Review Focus Areas

1. **TypeScript Code Quality**
   - Strict TypeScript usage with explicit types.
   - No `any` types - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown.
   - Proper type imports with `import type { }` syntax.
   - Component props interfaces defined using `$props`.
   - Proper use of SvelteKit's generated types (`./$types`).
   - Following TypeScript strict mode compliance.

2. **Svelte-Specific Patterns**
   - Proper Svelte 5 rune usage (`$state`, `$effect`, `$derived`).
   - Client-side routing with `goto()` instead of `window.location`.
   - Svelte components for UI, not just for logic.
   - Proper use of `+page.ts` and `+layout.ts` for data loading.
   - Store usage for managing global state.

3. **Performance & Bundle Optimization**
   - No unnecessary client-side JavaScript.
   - Efficient use of reactivity to avoid performance issues.
   - Image optimization with assets in `static/`.
   - Bundle size considerations.
   - No large components rendered inside `#each` loops.

4. **Security & Validation**
   - Input validation with Zod schemas.
   - Environment variables properly typed and used (`$env/dynamic/public`, `$env/dynamic/private`).
   - Tauri capabilities correctly scoped.
   - No hardcoded secrets in client-side code.
   - API route validation with proper error handling.

5. **Data Management**
   - Correct database driver usage (sql.js for browser, better-sqlite3 for server).
   - Conditional imports for platform-specific code.
   - Type-safe queries with Drizzle ORM.

6. **Package Management**
   - Using `bun` (not `npm` or `yarn`).
   - Proper dependency management.
   - No unused dependencies.
   - Correct dev vs. runtime dependencies.

7. **Code Structure & Architecture**
   - Components kept concise and focused.
   - Functions with a single responsibility.
   - Proper separation of concerns (UI, state, data fetching).
   - Feature-based organization.

8. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Vitest configuration and tests.
   - 80%+ test coverage maintained.
   - Component tests for UI and logic.
   - `load` function tests.
   - Proper mocking of external dependencies.

9. **Build & Development**
   - `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors.
   - `bun lint` compliance with zero warnings.
   - `bun format` applied.
   - Production build (`bun build`, `bun tauri build`) succeeds.

10. **Documentation & Maintenance**

- Clear component interfaces with JSDoc.
- Proper prop descriptions.
- `vibes/guidebook.md` updates for new patterns/dependencies.
- `README.md` updates if needed.
